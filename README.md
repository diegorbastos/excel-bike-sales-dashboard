## Data Preparation
Steps performed before analysis:

Cleaned categorical values (e.g., standardized commute bands).
Removed duplicates and checked for missing values.
Created a new feature: Age Brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
Converted “Purchased Bike” into consistent Yes/No flags.
Structured data in a Working Sheet ready for pivot tables.
